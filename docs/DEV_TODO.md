# TODO

## Visual

* Should proficiency show still under Attributes?
* Initiative doesn't display right if affected by a DAE
* Some of the wording of targeting is incorrect now with the field changes. Specifically "enemies within 5 feet", that sort of thing.

## Module Ecosystem

* Custom DAE hooks for scalar stats

## Data Entry

* Ability Modifiers should be high/medium/low rather than ranking, or at least display that way

## Compendiums

* Many of the entries have not been migrated to v3 

## Modal/Info Updates

* I'm sure there's lots!
* Remove unused localization entries referring to deprecated data
* Rename localization entries based on new uses
* Consolidate duplicate attack_bonus + proficiency modifiers
* Deprecation: Update ability_modifiers to have ability + check
